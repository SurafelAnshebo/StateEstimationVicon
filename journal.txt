Why do I occasionally see duplicate markers in the 3D Workspace after I calibrate?

Typically, this is due to subsets of cameras being well calibrated together and those subsets not agreeing enough with each other. 
This can cause reconstructions to be generated from each subset, quite close in position to each other.
Try to capture during the wand wave, plenty of frames where all cameras see the wand at the same time if possible. 
A good strategy is to wave the wand across the floor with LEDs facing vertically upwards.

If not all cameras, try to ensure that cameras on two or three adjacent walls or two opposing walls can collect wand frames at the same time.

Try to avoid only waving the wand close to the edge of the volume where only 2 or 3 cameras may see the wand at the same time.

Before you begin camera calibration, ensure that: Cameras have fully warmed up to a stable operating temperature. Vicon recommends a minimum 30â€“60 minute warm-up period.

Parameters I changed 

EKF2_EV_CTRL 15 > 8 (Adam said 3 but it is 8 in the documentation)
EKF2_EV_DELAY 0.0 > 0.1
EKF2_EV_NOISE_MD 1 (left it as it is)
EKF2_GPS_CHECK 245 (I didnt change this)

EKF2_HGT_REF gps > vision
SYS_HAS_GPS 1 > 0
EKF2_GPS_CHECK 245 > 0 .......... maxpdop, max vertical position error, max vertical velocity discrepancy (these were unchecked the rest are all checked)

According to PX4 doc - to fly offboard PX4 expects the external controller provides a continuous 2Hz "proof of life" signal, by streaming any of the supported MAVLink setpoint messages or the ROS 2 OffboardControlMode message. PX4 enables offboard control only after receiving the signal for more than a second, and will regain control if the signal stops.
